# zmq-nodejs-guide
ZMQ - NodeJS Guide is a vuepress guide to using ZMQ in NodeJS. 

NodeJS is an `asynchronous event-driven` JavaScript runtime. There it is, clearly says that it best suits ZMQ library and it's core functionalities. 
The extension of zmq using NodeJS is relatively simplified using the NodeJS way.

# Introduction to ZeroMQ
#### (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq, let's stick to `ZMQ`)

ZeroMQ (ZMQ) is a brilliant messaging library that empowers programmers a network of sockets for communication across a wide range of transport protocols. A most versatile concurrency framework written originally in 'C' language and made available in almost every programming language as of today. 

::: tip Heterogeneity 
A mouthful but 'bona fide' term to define ZMQ Sockets, because it offers an universe Sockets that can be assembled, decoupled or reconnected in patterns such as fan-out, pubsub, task distribution and last but not the least, traditional request-reply pattern.

## Pieter Hintgens - The man behind the magic!

If you're interested to learn and work with ZeroMQ, it would be preposterous to continue with out knowing the root and
it's origin and most importantly the soul behind this magic library. This guide is dedicated to Pieter Hintgens




It's a simple effort to implement socket patterns in NodeJS and discuss the possibilities.
