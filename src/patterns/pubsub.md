# Pubsub Pattern

A Publisher-Subscriber pattern. In this model, the Publisher doesn't wait for requests from a subscriber rather it goes on publishing things. Consider the radio station few decades ago. The programmes are broadcast and on the air any subscriber who wants to listen to the radio would turn on the radio and receive information. 

Here, the subscriber may come and go as they please. The Publisher's job is just to broadcast what they're told to.
