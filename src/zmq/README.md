# Introduction to ZeroMQ

#### (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq, let's stick to `ZMQ`)

ZeroMQ (ZMQ) is a brilliant messaging library that empowers programmers a network of sockets for communication across a wide range of transport protocols. A most versatile concurrency framework written originally in 'C' language and made available in almost every programming language as of today. Heterogeneity - a mouthful but 'bona fide' term to define ZMQ Sockets, because it offers an universe Sockets that can be assembled, decoupled or reconnected in patterns such as fan-out, pubsub, task distribution and last but not the least, traditional request-reply pattern.

A vivid feature of ZMQ sockets and patterns derived from it, is that it empolys asynchronus I/O model for a lightning fast message transport across inproc, IPC, TCP, UDP, TIPC, multicast and Websocket. 

ZMQ is actively used by Microsoft, Samsung, AT&T, Facebook, Digital Ocean and many other major communication & software companies.

# Pieter Hintgens - The man behind the magic!



If you're interested to learn and work with ZeroMQ, it would be preposterous to continue with out knowing the root and it's origin and most importantly the soul behind this magic library.

It's Pieter Hintgens (3 Dec 1962 - 4 Oct 2016) - a belgian software architect, author and past president of [Foundation of a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_a_Free_Information_Infrastructure).

He served as a CEO and chief software designer for iMatix and believed & active in [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) 

His demise is a huge loss to Software Industry.

To learn more about his personality and contributions to the programming world, I would recommend users to read his books 'Confessions of a Necromancer' and 'Social Architecture'.
