# Building blocks of the ZeroMQ Socket Universe
Let's discuss the basic building blocks of the socket 

## Sockets
Fundamental block of Core ZMQ Architecture employs 

 - TCP (Transmission Control protocol )
 - INPROC (In-Process Communications protocol)
 - IPC (Inter Process Communications - on POSIX)
 - TIPC (a nice protocol from Ericsson)
 - PGM (reliable multicast)
 - NORM (one more reliable multicast)
 - SOCKS5 
 - TOR

 since version 4.2, libzmq supports UDP in Unicast and Multicast modes.

Eventhough as many protocols it can talk to, libzmq (the core ZMQ library) is most widely using and focussing TCP protocol - the 'lingua franca' of distributed computing.
